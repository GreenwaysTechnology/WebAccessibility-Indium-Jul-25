								‚ÄúThe power of the Web is in its universality.
						Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.‚Äù

						Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web


Versions of WCAG:

WCAG 2.0 - old version 
  core accessibility principles - POUR
WCAG 2.1 - new Version
     Adds support for mobility, low vision, cognitive disability
WCAG 2.2 - Latest version
    Extends 2.1 with focus on cognitive, learning, fine motor disability 
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************
								   Accessibility Compliance
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************
The WCAG define three levels of compliance , to measure how accessible a website or digital content is


Level                                                       Meaning                                           who benefits

A                                                  Minimum Accessibility                               Essential for people with sever and normal disabilities 


AA	                                            Recommended level                                Address major barriers for most users

AAA                                            Advanced level accessibility                    Focus all types of disabilities , it is very hard to achieve

Basic HTML Design for Level -A Accessibility:
...........................................................................

create html project

>mkdir myweb

basic html template
index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Heading</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
					
How to run?
 we are going to install web server in vscode as plugin. - live server			 


Guide Line 

1.Should be meaning full.
  Here title 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Web Accessibility Guide Line Training</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

2.Use Semantic HTML Elements as much as possible

Semantic Elements  = Elements with a meaning

A semantic element clearly defines its meaning to both the browser and the developers and also users(disability Users)

Semantic elements are used to design web layouts.

1.header
2.footer
3.main
4.nav
5.section
6.aside
7.figcaption
8.summary
9.time
10.figure
12.mark
13.article

Other elements
button
img
label
form
input

Avoid Using div, span for layout purpose

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Web Accessibility GuideLine Training</title>
</head>

<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to Accessibility</h1>
        <nav>
            <a href="#home">Home</a>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>About Accessibility</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>About Disabilities</h2>
        </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <nav>
            <a href="#contactus">Contact us</a>
        </nav>
    </footer>
</body>

									  Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility


"Easy Checks ‚Äì A First Review of Web Accessibility" is a practical guide developed by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to help anyone (not just experts) quickly check the accessibility of a web page.

üåê What is "Easy Checks"?
	It's a preliminary evaluation method that helps you identify basic accessibility barriers on web pages.
      It doesn‚Äôt replace full accessibility audits, but it‚Äôs great for:

1.Spot-checking websites
2.Raising awareness about accessibility
3.Getting quick wins before deeper evaluation

‚úÖ Key Accessibility Areas Covered in Easy Checks:

1.Page Title
2.Image text alternatives(alt text") (pictures, illustrations, charts etc)
3.Text
    Headings
    Contrast ratio (color contrast)
    Resize text
4.Interaction
     Keyboard access and visual focus
     Forms, labels, and errors (including search fields)
5. General
      Moving ,flashing or blinking content
      Multimedia (video,audio) alternatives
      Basic Structure check - Semantic Elements 

Page Title:
..................

Check:
  1.Does every page have a clear, unique title?
   Why: Helps screen reader users and improves navigation.
Tips:
   1.Always look at title when you design a page - You have to audit manually

Image text alternatives:
.......................................
1.Text alternatives ("alt text") convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.
2.Text alternatives are used by people who do not see the image. (For example, people who are blind and use screen readers can hear the         alt text read out; and people who have turned off images to speed download or save bandwidth can see the alt text.)
3.The text should be functional and provide an equivalent user experience, not necessarily describe the image. (For example, appropriate        text alternative for a search button  would be "search", not "magnifying glass".)
4.You don't usually see the alt text on a web page, it is in the web page markup (like this:
<img src="pointer_to_image.png" alt="here's where the alternative text goes">).
Every image should include alt in the markup.
5.If an image conveys information useful for interacting with or understanding the web page content, then it needs alternative text.
6.If an image is just decorative and people don't need to know about the image, then it should have null alt (alt="").
Automated tests can tell you if alt is missing. To determine if the alternative text is appropriate, you need to see the image and judge it in context.

How to check / verify the web site or page images has alt attribute?

There are various ways to check:

1.Using browser dev tool called img  - browser specific
    In the toolbar you can select "images" - if browser does not have this option
2.To check alt text with any browser
     WAVE - tool

	WAVE¬Æ is a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities.
       WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of                     web content.
How to use Wave?

1.You can use wave directly
     https://wave.webaim.org/
2.You can install wave browser plugin

Wave Summary Report:

1.Errors
2.Contrast Errors
3.Alerts
4.Features
5.Structural Elements
6.ARIA

1.Errors:
 1.1. Issues that will impact certain users with disabilities
 1.2.Failures to meet WCAG

Error Report:

Errors
   Missing alternative text

What It Means
	Image alternative text is not present.

Why It Matters
	Each image must have an alt attribute. Without alternative text, the content of an image will not be available to screen reader users or 	when the image is unavailable.

How to Fix It
	Add an alt attribute to the image. The attribute value should accurately and succinctly present the content and function of the image. If the content of the image is conveyed in the context or surroundings of the image, or if the image does not convey content or have a function, it should be given empty/null alternative text (alt="").

The Algorithm... in English
	An image does not have an alt attribute.
Standards and Guidelines
    1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)

Task:
  1.Create a sample web page , having some images, test without alt attribute and add alt attribute and also test
    Using wave 
eg:
   <img src="banner.jpg">
