How to design Web?

HTML,CSS + JavaScript

Design fundamentals:

1.layout
   fixed width (before 2007), responsive, grid, flex
2.colors and themes
3.fonts 
4.images and videos

IS there any specification for designing web?

What is specification or spec?

Set of rules and regulations followed

Is there is any spec is available for web?
Yes---WCAG  - Web content Accessibility Guideline

Versions of WCAG:

WCAG 2.0 - old version 
  core accessibility principles - POUR
WCAG 2.1 - new Version
     Adds support for mobility, low vision, cognitive disability
WCAG 2.2 - Latest version
    Extends 2.1 with focus on cognitive, learning, fine motor disability 
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************
								   Accessibility Compliance
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************
The WCAG define three levels of compliance , to measure how accessible a website or digital content is


Level                                                       Meaning                                           who benefits

A                                                  Minimum Accessibility                               Essential for people with sever and normal disabilities 


AA	                                            Recommended level                                Address major barriers for most users

AAA                                            Advanced level accessibility                    Focus all types of disabilities , it is very hard to achieve

Basic HTML Design for Level -A Accessibility:
...........................................................................

create html project

>mkdir myweb

basic html template
index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Heading</title>

How to run?
 we are going to install web server in vscode as plugin. - live server			 


Guide Line 

1.Should be meaning full.
  Here title 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

</html>

2.Use Semantic HTML Elements as much as possible

Semantic Elements  = Elements with a meaning

A semantic element clearly defines its meaning to both the browser and the developers and also users(disability Users)

Semantic elements are used to design web layouts.

1.header
2.footer
3.main
4.nav
5.section
6.aside
7.figcaption
8.summary
9.time
10.figure
12.mark
13.article

Other elements
button
img
label
form
input

Avoid Using div, span for layout purpose

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

									  Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility


"Easy Checks ‚Äì A First Review of Web Accessibility" is a practical guide developed by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to help anyone (not just experts) quickly check the accessibility of a web page.

üåê What is "Easy Checks"?
	It's a preliminary evaluation method that helps you identify basic accessibility barriers on web pages.
      It doesn‚Äôt replace full accessibility audits, but it‚Äôs great for:

1.Spot-checking websites
2.Raising awareness about accessibility
3.Getting quick wins before deeper evaluation

‚úÖ Key Accessibility Areas Covered in Easy Checks:

1.Page Title
2.Image text alternatives(alt text") (pictures, illustrations, charts etc)
3.Text
    Headings
    Contrast ratio (color contrast)
    Resize text
4.Interaction
     Keyboard access and visual focus
     Forms, labels, and errors (including search fields)
5. General
      Moving ,flashing or blinking content
      Multimedia (video,audio) alternatives
      Basic Structure check - Semantic Elements 

Page Title:
..................

Check:
  1.Does every page have a clear, unique title?
   Why: Helps screen reader users and improves navigation.
Tips:
   1.Always look at title when you design a page - You have to audit manually

Image text alternatives:
.......................................
1.Text alternatives ("alt text") convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.
2.Text alternatives are used by people who do not see the image. (For example, people who are blind and use screen readers can hear the         alt text read out; and people who have turned off images to speed download or save bandwidth can see the alt text.)
3.The text should be functional and provide an equivalent user experience, not necessarily describe the image. (For example, appropriate        text alternative for a search button  would be "search", not "magnifying glass".)
4.You don't usually see the alt text on a web page, it is in the web page markup (like this:
<img src="pointer_to_image.png" alt="here's where the alternative text goes">).
Every image should include alt in the markup.
5.If an image conveys information useful for interacting with or understanding the web page content, then it needs alternative text.
6.If an image is just decorative and people don't need to know about the image, then it should have null alt (alt="").
Automated tests can tell you if alt is missing. To determine if the alternative text is appropriate, you need to see the image and judge it in context.

How to check / verify the web site or page images has alt attribute?

There are various ways to check:

1.Using browser dev tool called img  - browser specific
    In the toolbar you can select "images" - if browser does not have this option
2.To check alt text with any browser
     WAVE - tool

	WAVE¬Æ is a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities.
       WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of                     web content.
How to use Wave?

1.You can use wave directly
     https://wave.webaim.org/
2.You can install wave browser plugin

 1.2.Failures to meet WCAG

Error Report:

Errors
   Missing alternative text

What It Means
	Image alternative text is not present.

Why It Matters
	Each image must have an alt attribute. Without alternative text, the content of an image will not be available to screen reader users or 	when the image is unavailable.

How to Fix It
	Add an alt attribute to the image. The attribute value should accurately and succinctly present the content and function of the image. If the content of the image is conveyed in the context or surroundings of the image, or if the image does not convey content or have a function, it should be given empty/null alternative text (alt="").

The Algorithm... in English
	An image does not have an alt attribute.
Standards and Guidelines
    1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)

Task:
  1.Create a sample web page , having some images, test without alt attribute and add alt attribute and also test
    Using wave 
eg:
   <img src="banner.jpg">
************************************************************************************************************************************************************
										Contrast Errors
									      (Very low contrast)
************************************************************************************************************************************************************
1.Text that does not meet WCAG contrast requirements

What It Means:
	Very low contrast between text and background colors.

Why It Matters
         Adequate contrast of text is necessary for all users, especially users with low vision.

How to Fix It
	Increase the contrast between the foreground (text) color and the background color.
        Large text (larger than 18 point or 14 point bold) does not require as much contrast as smaller text.

The Algorithm:

	   Text is present that has a contrast ratio less than 4.5:1, or large text (larger than 18 point or 14 point bold) has a contrast ratio less than 3:1.
		 WCAG requires that page elements have both foreground AND background colors defined (or inherited) that provide sufficient contrast. When text is presented over a background image, the text must have a background color defined (typically in CSS) that provides adequate text contrast when the background image is disabled or unavailable. 

		WAVE does not identify contrast issues in text with CSS transparency, gradients, or filters.
                WCAG Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.

How to give right contrast colors to elements?
  Will discuss later
************************************************************************************************************************************************************
												3.Alerts
************************************************************************************************************************************************************  1.That may cause accessibility issues
2. A Evaluator must decide the impact

Report:

1.Redundant alternative text
   
  " The alternative text for an image is the same as nearby or adjacent text."

<div class="a-section a-spacing-none _fluid-quad-image-label-v2_style_fluidImageContainer__2SOMr">

2.A nearby image has the same alternative text

<img alt="BHAAKUR Cotton Jhabla Set for Infants and Toddlers | Snap Buttons Jabla |Soft Mulmul |Breathable and Comfortable | Top..." src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mInU4fLEL._AC_SY200_.jpg" class="product-image" height="200px" data-a-hires="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mInU4fLEL._AC_SY400_.jpg">

3.Long alternative text
   <img alt="Napoleon Travel Q 285 Portable Gas Grill ‚Äì 2-Burner LPG BBQ Cast Iron Cooking Grates, JETFIRE Ignition, Folding Legs &amp;..." src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JG2awjdfL._AC_SY200_.jpg" class="product-image" height="200px" data-a-hires="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JG2awjdfL._AC_SY400_.jpg">

4.Orphaned form label

Not Good
<label id="captions-foreground-color-vjs_video_3_component_777" class="vjs-label">
       Color
</label>

Good:
<form>	
<label id="captions-foreground-color-vjs_video_3_component_777" class="vjs-label">
       Color
</label>
	<input type="text" id="captions-foreground-color-vjs_video_3_component_777">
</form>

5.Unlabeled form control with title

What It Means
A form control does not have a label, but has a title.

Why It Matters
	The title attribute value for unlabeled form controls will be presented to screen reader users. 
	However, a properly associated text label provides better usability and accessibility and should be used unless the purpose of the form control is intuitive without the label.

How to Fix It
If a visible text label is available for the form control, associate the text label to the form control using the label element. 
This provides additional functionality for end users because if the label is clicked it will set focus to the form control. If the form control is intuitive without a <label>, the title attribute value may be used.
Note that the title attribute value will not generally be read by a screen reader if the control has a label and may not be available to sighted users, particularly keyboard-only users.

Standards and Guidelines
...............................................
    1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)
    1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
    2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)
    3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
****************
6. Missing first level heading

What It Means
	A page does not have a first level heading.

Why It Matters
	Headings facilitate page navigation for users of many assistive technologies. 
	They also provide semantic and visual meaning and structure to the document. 
        A first level heading (<h1>) should be present on nearly all pages. 
        It should contain the most important heading on the page (generally the document title).

How to Fix It
       If the page presents a main heading, place it within an <h1> element. Add other sub-headings as necessary.

Standards and Guidelines

    1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
    2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)
